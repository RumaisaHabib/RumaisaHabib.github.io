## Welcome! 🐸💻

I am a computer scientist, researcher, student, and frog enthusiast. I am currently transitioning from an **undergraduate** at **LUMS**{: style="color: yellow;"} to a **PhD student** at **Stanford University**{: style="color: yellow;"}. My research mainly focuses on Internet measurements, societal web, privacy/security, and networks. However, I am flexible and driven to mitigate real-world problems, especially for underrepresented groups.

At LUMS, I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi](https://www.ihsanqazi.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Dr. Zafar Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Zartash Afzal Uzmi](https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/713){:target="_blank"} on three main projects. *(1)*{: style="color: yellow;"} We have a body of work on making the Internet more affordable through technical and policy solutions. We provide large scale measurement studies to bring the problem to light and design a framework that solves an optimization problem to reduce webpage complexity whilst maintaining quality. I have  also worked on *(2)*{: style="color: yellow;"} improving the anonymity of Hidden Services on Tor using Trusted Execution Environments and *(3)*{: style="color: yellow;"} efficient program debloating to reduce the attack surface of popular tools.
