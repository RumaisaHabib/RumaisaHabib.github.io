## Welcome! 🐸💻

My name is Rumaisa and I am a computer scientist, researcher, student, and frog enthusiast. My research interests lie in the domain of network improvements (security, availability and performance) and Internet measurements. I also enjoy building large scale systems.

Currently, I am an undergraduate student at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) working under the supervision of [Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~ihsan/), [Dr. Zafar Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/) and [Dr. Zartash Afzal Uzmi](https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/713). Our work focuses on network improvements and measurements. Particularly, we are working on making the Internet more equitable.
