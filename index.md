## Welcome!

My name is Rumaisa and I am a computer scientist, researcher, painter, student, and frog enthusiast. My research interests lie in the domain of network improvements, Internet measurements, and building network systems and architectures.

Currently, I am an undergraduate student at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) working under the supervision of [Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~ihsan/), [Dr. Zafar Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/) and [Dr. Zartash Afzal Uzmi] (https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/713). We are working on changing the Internet design to make it more affordable.
