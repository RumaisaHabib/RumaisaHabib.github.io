## Welcome! üê∏üíª

My name is Rumaisa and I am a computer scientist, researcher, student, and frog enthusiast. I am transitioning from an undergraduate at LUMS to a PhD student at Stanford University. My research mainly focuses on Internet measurements, societal web, privacy/security, and networks. However, I am flexible and driven to mitigate real-world problems, especially for underrepresented groups.

At LUMS, I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi](https://www.ihsanqazi.com/), [Dr. Zafar Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/) and [Dr. Zartash Afzal Uzmi](https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/713) on three main projects. *(1)*{: style="color: yellow;"} We have a body of work on making the Internet more affordable through technical and policy solutions. We provide large scale measurement studies to bring the problem to light and design a framework that solves an optimization problem to reduce webpage complexity whilst maintaining quality. Moreover, I have worked on *(2)*{: style="color: yellow;"} improving the anonymity Hidden Services on Tor using Trusted Execution Environments and *(3)*{: style="color: yellow;"} efficient program debloating to reduce the attack surface of popular tools.
